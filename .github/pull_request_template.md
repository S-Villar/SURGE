## Roadmap / plan link

<!-- If this PR is a scheduled item, link the section of
docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md, or docs/RELEASE_SPRINT.md.
E.g. "closes T1.3 of docs/RELEASE_SPRINT.md". -->

## Test plan

<!-- How did you verify this locally? Paste the relevant pytest output
or CLI banner. At minimum: -->

- [ ] `pytest -q tests/` passes locally
- [ ] `pytest -q tests/test_e2e_release_smoke.py` passes locally
- [ ] New public APIs have at least one direct unit test
- [ ] The `[surge.fit] ...` banner still fires exactly once per model
      train (if training code was touched)

## Backwards compatibility

- [ ] No public API change
- [ ] Public API change, documented above and in `docs/ROADMAP.md`

## Checklist

- [ ] No absolute NERSC-style paths (`/global/homes/...`, `/pscratch/...`)
      added to tracked source
- [ ] No large binary / data blobs added to `data/` or elsewhere
- [ ] Commit messages use imperative, present-tense style
